# Changelog - PostgreSQL Tools

All notable changes to the PostgreSQL database migration tools will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- **`--llm` reference listed wrong `DBBACKUPTYPE` values**: The self-contained `--llm` reference document claimed `DBBACKUPTYPE` accepts `custom / plain / dir / tar`, but all three orchestrators only handle `custom` (default, `pg_restore -Fc`), `dir` (`pg_restore -Fd`), and `file` (`psql -f`) — any other value aborts with `Unknown backup type`. Corrected the two occurrences (operation summary and environment-variable list) to `custom / dir / file` in `debee.ps1`, `debee.sh`, and `debee.py`, keeping the `--llm` text byte-for-byte identical across all three. Version bumped to 1.1.1 in lockstep so the corrected reference is verifiable from `--version`.

### Docs
- **Documented flags and env vars added in 1.0.2–1.1.0**: The human-facing docs (`README.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/operations.md`, `docs/cross-platform.md`, `docs/version-table.md`) and the `ai/` context files had drifted behind the code. Added the `-q`/`--silent`, `-y`/`--yes`, `-V`/`--version`, `--test-verbose`, `-h`/`--help`, and `--llm` flags to every CLI reference; documented the `DBPRODENVIRONMENT` production-confirmation gate, silent mode, and the `DBCREATEONRESTORE`, `DBRESTOREJOBCOUNT`, `DBVERSIONTABLEFILENAME`, `DBVERSIONTABLEOUTPUTFOLDER`, and `PGDATABASE` environment variables. Corrected the `debee.ps1 -Operations` documentation (it has no default and shows help when omitted; only `debee.sh`/`debee.py` default to `fullService`). No behavioral change beyond the `--llm` text fix above.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **`--llm` reference flag**: New `--llm` flag (bash, Python) and `-Llm` switch (PowerShell) prints a single self-contained CLI reference document — concept, invocation for all three implementations, every operation, the `NNN_*.sql` naming convention, all options, the `.env` file resolution order, every environment variable, and the production-confirmation gate — designed to be pasted into an LLM/AI assistant as full context. Modeled on the `--llm` flag in the sibling `pure-admin-cli` project. The reference text is ASCII-only (no em-dashes or arrows) so it prints cleanly on Windows consoles regardless of code page, and is byte-for-byte identical across `debee.ps1`, `debee.sh`, and `debee.py`. Advertised in each script's short help. Version bumped to 1.1.0 across all three orchestrators.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`restoreDatabase` broken in `debee.py` for custom/dir archives**: The pg_restore format flag was built as a single string `"-F c"` (or `"-F d"`) and passed as one element of the `subprocess.run` argv list. Because the list form bypasses the shell, no whitespace tokenization happens — pg_restore received a single argument `-F c` and parsed the format as `" c"`, aborting with `unrecognized archive format " c"; please specify "c", "d", or "t"`. Changed to the attached form `-Fc` / `-Fd` (a single valid token). Only `debee.py` was affected: `debee.sh` and `debee.ps1` already pass `-F` and the format letter as separate argv tokens. Version bumped in lockstep across all three orchestrators; no behavioral change to `debee.sh` / `debee.ps1`.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Migration range resolution in production confirmation**: When `DBPRODENVIRONMENT=true` was set, the confirmation banner displayed `Migration range: -1 -> -1` even if `DBUPDATESTARTNUMBER` / `DBUPDATEENDNUMBER` were set in the env file. The fallback from CLI args to env vars was only resolved inside the file-gatherer, which ran *after* the confirmation. Resolution is now performed once right after env files load, so `Confirm-Production` and the file-gatherer share the same values. CLI args still take precedence over env vars. Fixed in `debee.ps1`, `debee.sh`, and `debee.py`.

### Changed
- **Friendlier range display**: Migration range output in the production confirmation banner and the "Scripts to run" warning now reads as `all` (both unset), `78 onwards` (only start set), `up to 100` (only end set), or `78 -> 100` (both set), instead of leaking the internal `-1` sentinels. Applies to all three orchestrators.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **PowerShell UTF-8 encoding**: `debee.ps1` now starts with a UTF-8 BOM (`EF BB BF`) so Windows PowerShell 5.1 decodes the script as UTF-8 instead of Windows-1252. Without the BOM, any non-ASCII content in the script (em-dashes, accented characters in help text or messages) was mangled at parse time, which surfaced as garbled console output and could break string comparisons. PowerShell 7+ already defaults to UTF-8 and is unaffected. `debee.sh` and `debee.py` versions bumped in lockstep — no behavioral change to those orchestrators.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Silent mode**: New `-q`/`--silent` flag (bash, Python) and `-Silent`/`-q` switch (PowerShell) suppresses orchestration scaffolding output — env-file load messages, "Processing: <op>" / "Performing <op>..." banners, execSql banners, migration progress lines, and the final "All operations completed successfully!" line. Warnings, errors, and psql/pg_restore output remain visible, so piping `execSql --sql "..."` results no longer requires `2>/dev/null` tricks. Test runner output is unaffected (still controlled by `--test-verbose`).
- **Version flag**: New `-V`/`--version` flag (bash, Python) and `-Version`/`-V` switch (PowerShell) prints the orchestrator version and exits. Version constants (`DEBEE_VERSION` in bash, `__version__` in Python, `$DebeeVersion` in PowerShell) are now hard-coded at the top of each script so the CHANGELOG number is verifiable from the binary.

- **Production confirmation**: New env variable `DBPRODENVIRONMENT=true` marks an env file as production. When set, debee prints a summary (host, port, user, target DB, operations, SQL or migration range when applicable) and requires the user to type `yes` (full word, case-insensitive) before any operation runs. New `-y`/`--yes` flag (bash, Python) and `-Yes`/`-y` switch (PowerShell) bypasses the prompt for automation/CI use. The confirmation banner prints regardless of `--silent` — it is not orchestration chatter, it is a safety gate.

### Changed
- **PowerShell help screen**: `.\debee.ps1` (no args) previously triggered an interactive prompt for the mandatory `-Operations` parameter; it now prints a styled help screen listing operations, options, and examples. The `-Operations` parameter is no longer mandatory and has no default — running fullService is now an explicit choice (`-Operations fullService`) rather than the silent default of an empty invocation. New `-Help`/`-h`/`-?` switch shows the same screen explicitly.

### Docs
- **Windows UTF-8 setup**: New section in `docs/cross-platform.md` explaining how to mitigate `invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8"` errors when passing non-ASCII text via `--sql` on Windows. Covers per-shell configuration for PowerShell (`$PROFILE`), Git Bash (`~/.bashrc` + mintty), and Python (`PYTHONUTF8=1`), plus a `PGCLIENTENCODING=WIN1250` per-invocation fallback and the Windows system-wide UTF-8 locale toggle. No script changes — the fix lives in the shell environment, since debee passes `--sql` strings straight through to psql.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Test Runner (transaction mode)**: SQL error messages (e.g., `ERROR: column does not exist`) are now shown in silent mode. Previously, only sections containing `FAIL` strings were displayed — psql errors without `FAIL` were silently swallowed, forcing users to rerun with `--test-verbose` or manual wrappers to diagnose failures. Fixed in all three orchestrators (`debee.ps1`, `debee.sh`, `debee.py`).

- **Source Classification**: Dedicated "Source" column shows "Migration" or "Ad-hoc"
- **Clean File Paths**: No prefixes clutter file names - source type in separate column
- **Sortable Output**: Easy to filter and sort by source type in all formats
- **Flexible Structure**: No naming conventions required - any SQL file is processed
- **Version Control**: Ad-hoc changes tracked in documentation like regular migrations

### Example Usage
```bash
# Set ad-hoc directory and generate documentation
DBADHOCDIRECTORY=hotfix-scripts/ python extract-db-objects.py --format markdown

# Shows output like:
# | auth | fix_user_permissions | function | hotfix-scripts/user_fix.sql | 15 | 1 | Ad-hoc | hotfix-scripts/user_fix.sql:15 |
```

### Migration from v2.1.0
Simply add `DBADHOCDIRECTORY=your-adhoc-directory/` to your environment configuration to enable the feature.

## [2.2.1] - 2025-01-25

### Fixed

#### Environment Variable Inheritance Issue
- **debee.py**: Fixed subprocess calls in `prepare_version_table()` operation to properly pass environment variables
  - Added `env=os.environ` parameter to both `extract-db-objects.py` subprocess calls
  - Ensures `DBADHOCDIRECTORY` and other environment variables are available to the Python subprocess
  - Resolves issue where ad-hoc scripts were not being detected when using Python orchestrator

#### Impact
- **debee.sh**: No changes needed - inherits environment variables automatically from parent shell
- **debee.ps1**: No changes needed - PowerShell handles environment variable inheritance correctly
- **debee.py**: Fixed to match behavior of other orchestrators

### Technical Details
The Python `subprocess.run()` calls were missing the `env` parameter, causing child processes to not receive environment variables set by the orchestrator. This specifically affected:
- Ad-hoc script detection via `DBADHOCDIRECTORY` environment variable
- Any other custom environment variables used by `extract-db-objects.py`

### Migration from v2.2.0
No configuration changes required. Existing setups will automatically benefit from the fix.

```

## [3.0.1] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

#### File Filtering in Migration Processing
- **debee.ps1**: Fixed `Get-FilesByNumericPrefix` function to properly filter migration files
  - Added explicit validation for file pattern `^\d{3}_.*\.sql$`
  - Files must now start with exactly 3 digits, followed by underscore, and end with `.sql` extension
  - Prevents non-SQL files (like `ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE.md`) from being incorrectly processed
  - Adds informative skip message when files don't match expected pattern

#### Root Cause
The original filter `???_*` matched ANY 3 characters + underscore, not just digits. Files like `ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE.md` would pass the initial filter, then fail silently during numeric prefix extraction.

#### Impact
- Only affects `debee.ps1` orchestrator
- No configuration changes required
- Existing valid migration files (e.g., `060_create_table.sql`) continue to work normally

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

#### Folder-Based Test Suite Framework (`runTests` operation)
- **Suite Directories**: Test suites can now be organized as `test_*/` directories alongside flat `test_*.sql` files
- **Optional Manifest**: `test.json` file in suite directories for metadata
  - `name`: Display name (default: folder name humanized, e.g. `test_user_permissions` → `User Permissions`)
  - `description`: Optional description shown in output header
  - `always_cleanup`: Controls whether cleanup phase runs on failure (default: `true`)
- **Phase Convention**: Files within suites are organized by numeric prefix
  - **000–899**: Main phase (setup + execution + verification), runs in order, stops on first error or FAIL
  - **900–999**: Cleanup phase, always runs if `always_cleanup` is true, failures logged as warnings
- **Suite Discovery**: Automatically discovers both flat `test_*.sql` files and `test_*/` directories in `tests/`
- **Enhanced Summary**: Per-suite and per-file result counts alongside PASS/FAIL totals
- **Sample Test Suite**: `test_connectivity/` suite with setup, verification, and cleanup phases

### Improved

#### Error Detection in Test Runner
- **psql Exit Code Handling**: Nonzero psql exit codes now count as automatic FAIL across all orchestrators
- Previously psql errors could be silently ignored if no FAIL string appeared in output

### Technical Details

#### New Helper Functions
| Orchestrator | Functions Added |
|-------------|----------------|
| debee.py | `_read_test_manifest()`, `_invoke_test_sql_file()`, `_invoke_flat_test()`, `_invoke_suite_test()` |
| debee.ps1 | `Read-TestManifest`, `Invoke-TestSqlFile`, `Invoke-FlatTest`, `Invoke-SuiteTest` |
| debee.sh | `read_test_manifest`, `invoke_test_sql_file`, `invoke_flat_test`, `invoke_suite_test` |

#### New Data Structures (debee.py)
- `TestManifest` dataclass: Holds suite manifest data with defaults
- `TestResult` dataclass: Structured test result with pass/fail counts and error flag

#### JSON Parsing (debee.sh)
- Uses `python3 -c` one-liner for JSON manifest parsing (Python already required by project)

### Migration from v3.0.1
- No breaking changes — existing flat `test_*.sql` files continue to work unchanged
- To use suites, create a `test_*/` directory inside `tests/` with numbered SQL files
- Optional `test.json` manifest for custom suite name/description

### Example Usage
```bash
# Run all tests (flat files + suites)
./debee.sh -o runTests
python debee.py -o runTests
.\debee.ps1 -Operations runTests

# Filter to run only suite tests
./debee.sh -o runTests --test-filter connectivity

# Filter to run only flat file tests
./debee.sh -o runTests --test-filter connection
```

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

#### Test Suite Isolation Modes
- **Transaction Isolation** (`"isolation": "transaction"`): Wraps all setup + main files in a single `BEGIN`/`ROLLBACK` psql session
  - True transaction isolation — all changes are rolled back automatically
  - Uses `\set ON_ERROR_STOP on` to stop on SQL errors
  - Per-file output attribution via `>>>DEBEE_FILE: ...<<<` markers
  - Cleanup files (900-999) still run individually after the rollback
  - Temporary wrapper SQL file created and cleaned up in finally block
- **Database Isolation** (`"isolation": "database"`): Recreates and optionally restores the database before the suite
  - Calls existing `recreate_database()` before suite execution
  - Calls `restore_database()` if backup is configured (`DBBACKUPFILE`)
  - Switches back to `DBDESTDB` for test execution
  - Then runs shared setup + main files individually (same as `"none"`)
- **None Isolation** (`"isolation": "none"`): Current behavior, unchanged (default)
- Configured via `isolation` field in suite `test.json` manifest
- Unknown isolation values produce a warning and fall back to `"none"`

#### Shared Setup Scripts
- **`setup` field** in suite `test.json`: Array of paths relative to `tests/` directory
- Shared SQL files run before suite's own main files
- Enables reuse of common SQL (schema creation, seed data) across suites
- Works with all isolation modes:
  - `"none"`: Setup files run individually
  - `"transaction"`: Setup files included in the BEGIN/ROLLBACK wrapper
  - `"database"`: Setup files run individually after database recreation
- `tests/shared/` directory created as convention placeholder

#### Global Test Ordering
- **`tests/tests.json`**: Optional manifest for controlling test execution order
- `order` array specifies items to run first (in given order)
- Unlisted items follow alphabetically after ordered items
- If file is absent, current alphabetical behavior is preserved
- Works with `--test-filter` (ordering applied before filtering)

### Example Configuration

#### Suite `test.json` with isolation and shared setup:
```json
{
  "name": "Permissions Test",
  "description": "Test user permissions",
  "always_cleanup": true,
  "isolation": "transaction",
  "setup": ["shared/create_schema.sql", "shared/seed_data.sql"]
}
```

#### Global `tests/tests.json` with ordering:
```json
{
  "order": [
    "test_connection.sql",
    "test_connectivity"
  ]
}
```

### Technical Details

#### New Functions
| Orchestrator | Functions Added |
|-------------|----------------|
| debee.py | `_invoke_suite_transaction()` |
| debee.ps1 | `Invoke-SuiteTransaction` |
| debee.sh | `invoke_suite_transaction` |

#### Updated Data Structures
- `TestManifest` dataclass (debee.py): Added `isolation: str` and `setup: List[str]` fields
- Manifest hashtable (debee.ps1): Added `Isolation` and `Setup` keys
- Manifest globals (debee.sh): Added `_MANIFEST_ISOLATION` and `_MANIFEST_SETUP` variables

### Migration from v3.1.0
- No breaking changes — all existing test configurations work unchanged
- Add `"isolation": "transaction"` or `"isolation": "database"` to suite `test.json` to enable isolation
- Add `"setup": [...]` to suite `test.json` to enable shared setup scripts
- Create `tests/tests.json` with `"order": [...]` to control execution order

## [3.2.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

#### Silent-by-Default Test Runner
- **`--test-verbose` flag**: All three orchestrators now default to **silent mode** when running tests
  - Silent mode only prints the summary block and any failures — PASS lines are suppressed
  - On failure, the relevant test/suite header and FAIL/ERROR lines are printed for context
  - Use `--test-verbose` (Bash, Python) or `-TestVerbose` (PowerShell) to restore full output
- **Token-efficient for AI tools**: Reduces output noise when tests pass, ideal for CI and AI-assisted workflows

#### Usage
```bash
# Silent mode (default) — only summary + failures
./debee.sh -o runTests
python debee.py -o runTests
.\debee.ps1 -Operations runTests

# Verbose mode — all PASS/FAIL lines shown (previous behavior)
./debee.sh -o runTests --test-verbose
python debee.py -o runTests --test-verbose
.\debee.ps1 -Operations runTests -TestVerbose
```

### Fixed

#### PowerShell Measure-Object Bug
- **debee.ps1**: Fixed `Measure-Object -Property PassCount -Sum` failing on hashtable results in test summary
  - Changed to `ForEach-Object { $_.PassCount } | Measure-Object -Sum` pattern
  - Same fix applied for `FailCount`
  - Root cause: `Measure-Object -Property` does not work on hashtable values, only on object properties

### Migration from v3.2.0
- No breaking changes — tests now produce less output by default
- Add `--test-verbose` or `-TestVerbose` to restore previous verbose behavior

## [Unreleased]
